slides design

focus of each slide deck, for `coding-agents-intro`:
- `main/title.md`: Title slide, title is "Coding Agents for Everything"
- `main/intro.md`: Introduction to AI coding agents
- `main/history.md`: Development history of coding agents, from github copilot to claude-code/codex CLI-based agents
- `main/hypes.md`: Current hypes around coding agents
- `main/my-perspective.md`: Speaker's perspective on coding agents
- `main/human-in-the-loop.md`: Importance of human-in-the-loop in coding agents, human focuses on task definition (requirement to coding task) and validation (eliminate hullucination)
- `main/new-paradigm.md`: Coding agents as a new paradigm for programming, moving from writing code to defining tasks, and it starts to have its own methodologies and best practices, like BMAD, speckit, openspec, etc.
- `main/trends.md`: Trends in coding agents, overtime, tasks that are easy to verify (e.g., code generation with test cases) will be automated first, those things involving human factors is hard to automate, they are intrinsically vague and ambiguous.
- `main/what-it-means-for-programmers.md`: What coding agents mean for programmers, they will not replace programmers, but will change how programmers work, more focus on higher-level tasks, less on boilerplate code, more on human factors, communication skills, etc.
- `main/applications.md`: Various applications of coding agents, for development or non-development tasks, but from a developer's perspective, that is, we assume the user knows how to code to some extent
- `main/travel-agent.md`: Example of using coding agents as a travel planning assistant
- `main/patent-writing-agent.md`: Example of using coding agents to help write patent applications
- `main/paper-survey-agent.md`: Example of using coding agents to help with academic paper surveys
- `main/live-example.md`: Live coding example of building an application on the fly using coding agents
- `main/challenges.md`: Challenges is more in human factors, communication skill, task understanding, etc., rather than the technical capabilities of coding agents
